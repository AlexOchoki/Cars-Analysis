# About the Dataset
This dataset contains data about cars owned by a logistics company. It has information for 398 cars, each with details on fuel consumption in terms of miles per gallon (mpg), number of engine cylinders, displacement volume, horsepower, weight of the car, acceleration and car model year.

#Summary of the findings

- The trend in horsepower for the cars from USA seemed to be dropping from an average of 164 hp in 1970 to an average of 84hp in 1982 while those from Japan and Europe seemed to be in the fairly constant average around 80hp.
